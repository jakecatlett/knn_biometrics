# knn_biometrics
A k-Nearest Neighbors analysis used to identify users of mobile technology through biometric data that identifies walking patterns.

The master branch contains an .html file containing the slides used in the actual presentation.  The remaining files consist of the original .R file, containing the code used for the original analysis, and the RMarkdown (.Rmd) file, containing the code that was used to produce the .html presentation.  The remaining files consist of the image files, etc., which are required by the RMarkdown code to render the slides.

Note that the data required to run the code is not included here.
